# Cloedo
This is a team work for the Cloedo game.

This program consists of 3 main parts: 
    - Controller, 
    - Model, 
    - View; 
    - and assets (pictures for dice, cards, and icons of the game).
    
What I did include:
- Controller 
- View
- in the Model part: I did Game.java, Items.
- Assets: I did Animations for dice, Rooms, Envelop and all cards in it.
